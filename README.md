Interactive Mood Journal with Weather Integration
Overview
This is an interactive mood journal web application where users can record their moods, write notes, and track the weather at the time of their entry. The application integrates with a weather API to automatically fetch current weather conditions based on the user's location. It also supports dark mode, a calendar for selecting dates, and JWT authentication for secure login/logout functionality.

Mood Tracking: Users can select their mood using emojis (ðŸ˜Š, ðŸ˜”, ðŸ˜¡, ðŸ˜Ž, ðŸ¥²).

Note-Taking: Users can write a short note along with their mood entry.

Weather Integration: Automatically fetches and displays the current weather based on the user's geolocation.

Calendar: Allows users to select and view entries for specific dates.

Dark Mode: Toggle dark mode for a better user experience.

Authentication: Users must log in to add entries using JWT-based authentication.
